Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software engineering is the system application of engineering principles, techniques and tools to the development and maintenance of more effective software systems that involve software product testing and design maintenance.Traditional programming is where  there is already known methods that had been tested and deals with physical products.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
-Requirements that is collecting and recording the user needs and system requirements.
-Design that is producing detailed and high level software architecture layouts and user interface.
-Implementation that is by writing the code and developing the software in accordance with the design specifications.
-Testing that is by carrying out a number of tests to make sure the software meets the quality standards and functional requirements.
-Deployment that is by releasing the software to the users.
-Maintenance that is by giving continuing support, updates and improvements to the software.

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?

*Comparison
-Both monitor their progress using project management tools,they involve stakeholders to ensure more success and produce high quality software that meets the users requirements.
*Contrast 
-Agile has quick response to changes while waterfall has some difficulty in responding quickly.
-Agile models takes shorter period since they are iterative while waterfall models take longer periods since requirements are met first before the developments.
*Key differences
-Agile is flexible while Waterfall is not flexible.
-Agile has customer involvement more frequently since they need feedback while Waterfall is not that frequent.
*Scenarios
-For Agile, regular iterations are required in order to meet the users expectations examples spotify where we listen to music.
-For Waterfall, each step is done at a time example when doing construction of buildings.

Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
-Requirement engineering is the process of developing and verifying the system requirements.
process:
 -Inception - having a general understanding of the problem and required solution.
 - Elicitation - gathering the requirements from users.
 - Elaboration - establishing a refined requirements model.
 - Negotiation - conflict resolution for conflicting requirements.
 - Specification - documenting gathered information in a detailed manner.
 - Validation - confirming whether the products of requirements engineering are of quality.
-Importance is that it involves testing the specifications to ensure that the software system being developed will meet the needs of the users.it also involves testing the software system with designs or even through simulation.

Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
-Modularity helps in developing software with as few connections as possible making maintenance easier and improves the system’s understanding.
-Each module is created separately and can be modified with minimal effects on other modules therefore enhancing maintainability.
-The ability to add new modules or even improving the existing ones without changing the system as a whole makes it have a good scalability function.

Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
-Unit testing involves testing components of the software individually.
-Integration testing involves testing the interaction between various components.
-System testing involves testing the entire software system wholly.
-Acceptance testing involves testing the software against the user requirements ensuring that it meets the users requirements.
-Testing helps in identifying the errors that can occur during software development thus ensuring that the software is of good quality.

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
-Version Control Systems are software tools used to monitor and handle changes made to a code repository and its importance is that it  facilitates teamwork.
*Popular version control system examples:
-Git which has got improved speed and performance, keeps track of repository changes and work can be done offline.
-Subversion which keeps track of changes done on files and set of changes done to one or more files is done on a single commit. 

Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
-A software project manager leads a team assigned a certain task in order to achieve all the project goals within the constraints given.
-Responsibilities 
Identifies and mitigates risks,keeps the project in track, manages budgets and ensures that the final product meets the standards required.
-Challenges
Poor planning of the projects and having very unrealistic deadlines,poor allocation of resources,lack of communication among the team members and lack of skills from the team members.

Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Software maintenance is the process of updating, modifying and changing software to meet the users requirements.
-Perfective maintenance involves making proactive changes to software after being delivered to add new features and improve the users experience.
-Corrective maintenance involves reactive software modification to fix issues found after the program has been made available to the end users.
-Preventive maintenance involves proactive software modification following delivery with the aim of identifying and fixing the product flaws before the end users do.
-Adaptive maintenance involves making reactive changes to software after being delivered and ensure it continues to function in a changing environment.
*Maintenance is essential as it ensures the software continues to function the way is was designed and also perform some upgrades to enhance its performance.

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?

-Ethical issues: Exploitation of software, compliance with set laws and regulations,ensuring that the software is friendly for all users and ensuring privacy and data protection.
-Adhere to ethical standards: Maintaining privacy and data protection and adhering to the set rules ans regulations
